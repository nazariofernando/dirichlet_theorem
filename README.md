# dirichlet_theorem
If a and d are relatively prime positive integers, the arithmetic sequence beginning with a and increasing by d, 
i.e., a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ..., contains infinitely many prime numbers. 
This fact is known as Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, 
which had been conjectured by Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 - 1855) 
and was proved by Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805 - 1859) in 1837.
For example, the arithmetic sequence beginning with 2 and increasing by 3, i.e.,
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 
65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, ... ,

contains infinitely many prime numbers

2, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 89, ... .

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to write a program to find the nth prime number in this arithmetic sequence 
for given positive integers a, d, and n.

The solution is provided by the uncompiled c++ file. If you want to run the program, you must download the file and compile it
using a C++ compiler. The program accepts one input in the command line with 3 numbers, a, d, n, 
separeted by space, and outputs the right prime. The number a is the first number of the sequence (initial value). 
The number d is by how much the sequence is increasing (quotient). The number n is the nth prime.

For example:
- Input:
367 186 151

- Output:
92809
